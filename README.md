 BMS - cell at a time

This is an attempt at a single cell daisy chain Battery Management System. Emphasis is placed on minimum power draw and cost. Hopefully it is also reliable.

Most parts are over specified, however I worry that having the microcontroller powered directly from the cell could lead to bad things if the cell ever has a voltage spike on it. The type caused by a loose connection maybe especially bad.

Be warned.
